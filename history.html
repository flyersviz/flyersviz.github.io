			For too long the ice hockey (NHL) community has lingered in the Dark Ages, holding firmly to the sacred tenants of Goals, Assists, and +/-, along with 'intangible qualities' like <i>heart</i> and <i>grit</i> in evaluating players. Thankfully, there has been enlightenment spurred by the small, but relentless, analytics community (think Moneyball). They are not completely throwing away the old metrics (except for +/- and secondary assists, which are utterly <a href="http://www.arcticicehockey.com/2014/6/5/5602668/why-plus-minus-is-the-worst-statistic-in-hockey">useless</a>). Rather, they are trying to broaden our understanding of what specifically makes players valuable. They strive to find which skills are <i>repeatable</i> and which are noise. In investigating this question, we have found metrics that are significantly better than past metrics in predicting future success. While this may (or may not) be intuitive, the best predictor of future goals (and thus wins) is not goals, but rather shots; and not only shots-on-goal, but <i>unblocked shots towards the goal</i>. If you can consistently outshoot the other team while you are on ice, it leads to <i>more goals for</i> and <i>less goals against</i> ! In order to act smarter than we actually are, we give an unblocked shot-attempt a fancy name:  <i>Fenwick</i>. The Fenwick metric is part of a broader, fairly modern group of 'advanced stats' known as 'Possession Metrics'. Measuring Fenwick % (Fenwicks For/[Fenwicks For + Fenwicks Against]) still has its disadvantages, and there are many ways in which it is being <a href="https://hockey-graphs.com/2014/11/13/adjusted-possession-measures/">improved</a>, but it is still a fairly good predictor of future success. However, the story does not end there. <br><br>
			In 2013, Broad Street Hockey writer Eric Tulsky presented (at the MIT Sloan Analytics Conference) a <a href="http://www.sloansportsconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/Using%20Zone%20Entry%20Data%20To%20Separate%20Offensive,%20Neutral,%20And%20Defensive%20Zone%20Performance.pdf">game-changing paper</a> on a metric rarely ever measured: Zone Entries (how players transition into the offensive zone from the neutral zone with the puck). If you think of that scenario, three things can happen: they enter the zone with control of the puck, they 'dump' the puck in and try to recover it, or they fail to enter the zone due to a turnover/offside call. Through his Three Zones Project, Eric had a few interesting findings: <br>
			<div class = 'list'>1)  A team gets 0.66 shots (fenwicks) for each controlled entry on average, and 0.29 shots for each uncontrolled entry. <br>We call this <i>Expected Fenwick</i> or <i>Neutral Zone (NZ) Fenwick</i><br>
			&#9;2) &#9; A player's ability to enter a zone with control(or prevent controlled entry into a zone) is a repeatable metric.<br>
			&#9;3) &#9; A player can consistently outperform or underperform their expectation.<br>
			&#9;4) &#9; Their ability to create controlled entries offensively is <i>independent</i> of their ability to prevent controlled entries defensively.<br><br>
			</div>
			With these things in mind, we can further analyze an individual's zone entries with confidence that it paints a broader picture of a player's ability to generate shots-for and supress shots-against. Using this knowledge (along with puck possession metrics), a coach can identify one root cause of good/poor outcomes. For example, if a player has a negative fenwick, a coach could look at his zone entry statistics. Say he notices that the player consistently dumps the puck into the zone rather than trying to enter with control. However, once that player is in the zone, he actually <i>outperforms</i> his expected shots. The coach now knows that the player's struggle is not generating shots once he gets into the offensive zone; rather, it is just getting into the zone with control. Conversely, a player may be very good at entering the offensive zone with control, but his shot metrics are average. The coach notices that he is consistently underperforming according to expectation. In that case, the coach knows he has to alter his offensive zone system with that line. <br><br>
			Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/bsh_charlie">Charlie O'Connor</a> from <a href="http://www.broadstreethockey.com/">Broad Street Hockey</a> (a fantastic blog for the Philadelphia Flyers), we have access to multiple datasets of offensive and defensive zone entries for almost every game in the 2015-2016 NHL season. Charlie manually tracked who was on the ice for each zone entry and how many shots actually resulted from the entry. This allows us to expand upon individual zone entry statistics and do something that has <i>never</i> been done before: visualize how certain pairings of players affect zone entry and shot metrics. <br><br>Through the visualization below, you can select any player on the Philadelphia Flyers, get a breakdown of their offensive and defensive zone entries, and see how their performance was altered when paired with or without any other player on the team. This WoWY (with or without you) visualization offers invaluable insight that even the most trained hockey eyes will miss (mostly due to confirmation bias). With this, we can see complementary strengths or weaknesses of players affects their play in terms of Neutral Zone Fenwick, Actual Fenwick, and performance to expectation.
